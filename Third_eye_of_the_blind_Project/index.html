        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The third eye for blinds is an innovation that helps blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by
            detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notifying them with a buzzer sound or
            vibration. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth. It is the first wearable technology for
            blind people which resolves all the problems of existing technologies. Nowadays there are many instruments
            and smart-devices for visually impaired people for navigation.
            So the aim of the project is to develop a cheap and more efficient way to help visually impaired to navigate
            with greater comfort, speed and confidence.

            <strong>Hardware Requirements:</strong><br>
            Ardunio Nano, Ultra Sonic Sensor, Buzzer Module, Vibration Motor, Slide Switch, Power Supply

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>
            1. Arduino Nano is a small, breadboard-friendly development board based on an ATmega328P SMD package
            microcontroller and offers the same connectivity and specs of Arduino Uno in a small package. DC Power Jack
            is not available on this board so power can only be supplied by a Mini B USB port present on it or 6-20V
            unregulated external power supply from Pin 30 (Vin). Due to its small size, it's very popular among IoT
            based projects which need to be small and user friendly, in Robotics, in Automation, Instrumentation and
            Control systems.
            <br><br>
            2. An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound
            waves. GND – Ground pin VCC – Voltage pin Trig – Input sound value echo – Output sound wave
            <br><br>
            3. -ve to Ardunio GND and +ve to digital pin 5
            <br><br>
            4. It works as a navigation device for blind people.
            This system can be used to navigate by everyone not only visually impaired under certain circumstances like
            foggy mornings with low visibility.
            This system can also be used by patients suffering from various eye ailments like cataract, exophthalmia
            post eye operative situations and others.
            This system can be modified into a more sophisticated version of itself by using high-intensity ultrasonic
            waves to be used as navigation for geological explorations.
            <br><br>
            5. Thus, this project proposed the design and architecture of a new concept of Arduino based Virtual Eye for
            the blind people. A simple, cheap, efficient, easy to carry, configurable, easy to handle electronic
            guidance system with many more amazing properties and advantages is proposed to provide constructive
            assistant and support for the blind and visually impaired persons.
            The system will be efficient and unique in its capability in specifying the source and distance of the
            objects that may encounter the blind. It is able to scan and detect the obstacles in the areas like left,
            right, and in front of the blind person regardless of its height or depth. With the proposed architecture,
            if constructed with at most accuracy, the blind will be able to move from one place to another without
            others' help.

        <h2>Working Principle</h2>
        <p>
            This proposed system consists of equipment like Arduino mini pro, ultrasonic sensor, pref board, vibrating
            motor, buzzers for detecting the obstacles and letting the user know about the obstacle, Red LEDs, Switches,
            Jumper cable, power bank, Male and female header pins, 3.3-volt old mobile battery which is unused or
            discarded, some elastic and stickers to make the device wearable as a band for wearing for the users.
            <br><br> The wiring of the device is done in a following manner. The Ground of LED, buzzer, and vibration
            motor are
            connected to GND of the Arduino. The +ve of the LED and the middle leg of the switch are connected to the
            Arduino pin 5. The +ve of the Buzzer is wired to the first leg of the switch and the +ve of the Vibration
            motor is wired to the third leg of the switch. The Ultrasonic sensor is wired accordingly. The Ultrasonic
            sensor pin VCC is connected to the Arduino pin VCC, Ultrasonic sensor pin GND is connected to the Arduino
            pin GND, Ultrasonic sensor pin Trig is attached to the Arduino pin 12, Ultrasonic sensor pin Echo is
            connected to the Arduino PIN 12. The switch used here is for selecting the mode. (Buzzer or vibration mode.)
            <br><br> We first cut the pref board in 5 X 3 cm dimension and solder the female headers for the Arduino to
            the
            board. Then soldering of the buzzer is carried out. Then using the glue connect the vibrating motor and
            solder the wires to it. Then connection of the LED is done. Then connect the switch. Connect the header pins
            for ultrasonic sensors and for the battery input. Then solder all the things and connect the Arduino and
            ultrasonic sensor to the board. Also connect the elastic band to all the modules. For making the module for
            the hand, connect the ultrasonic sensor to the board by using 4 jumper cables. Then connect a 3.7 volt
            mobile battery to this module. Then connect the elastic band. In the end after all the connections are done
            to the Arduino board, upload the code to each Arduino board and power the 4 other modules using a power
            bank. <br><br>
            The US sensor is a transducer, and is used in pair as a trans receiver. The transmitter emits the US waves
            and if obstacles are present in the path, the US waves hit the obstacles and get reflected back, the
            reflected wave is received by the receiver. The US sensor is a combination of one transmitter and receiver.
            The time interval between sending and receiving of the US signal is calculated, this time interval is used
            to calculate the distance THIRD EYE OF THE BLIND Department of ECE, AIET Page no. 57 between sensor and the
            obstacle. The equation for the distance calculation between the sensor and the object is as follows:
            D = (HPTW * SV)/2 Where, D = Distance in cm. HPTW = High time of pulse width. SV = Sound velocity in cm/s.
            <br><br> The sensors which are placed in the waist belt are in such a manner that the Ultrasonic pulses of
            sensors
            must not be overlapped one over the other. Sensors have a field of view (coverage) of about 60 degrees for 4
            feet distance, as the distance from the sensor increases, the coverage angle decreases. Thus, the objective
            is to cover a wide angle to detect the obstacles with the help of the ultrasonic sensors to help the blind
            and make it easy for them to move around easily without any hassle. Hence, the distance calculation is
            calculated and the sensor detects and the further procedure of the buzz sound to the user is carried out.
            <br><br> Thus, this way Third Eye for Blind will be designed for the visually impaired people and will make
            it very
            easy and convenient as it will be a wearable device and thus will help the user in traveling and detecting
            the obstacles while walking very easily.

            1. One can wear the Glove in Hand and Straps in Shoulder and Legs, Since we have made a working model, we
            have made a single kit.

            <br><br>
            7. If the Object is far, it does not Trigger the buzzer.
            <br><br>
            8. If the Object is Nearby, it triggers the beep.
            <br><br>
            9. As the buzzer beeps, one can know that the object is nearby and may collide and hence change the
            Direction Accordingly.
